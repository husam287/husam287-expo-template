## âš¡ Stack and Dependencies

* [**React Navigation**](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/): For navigating through screens, we are using react navigation's tab and stack navigators. Additionally, react navigation has [custom theming support](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/themes) built in, which is defined in *src/constants/theme*. 
* [**Redux Toolkit**](): We use redux toolkit to manage universal state. An introduction into redux toolkit can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zySeP5vH9c).
* [**Axios hooks**](): To use axios as react hook with the aim of [axios hook package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-hooks)
* [**Icomoon**](): To use custom icons using icon component and files generated from [Icomoon website](https://icomoon.io/)
* **Absolute Imports:** To avoid annoying relative.
* **Form Validation:** We are using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) to validate our user inputs, checking them in our form-input component while passing the yup schema in the screens
