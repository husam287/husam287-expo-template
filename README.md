# husam287-expo-template

> To use this template, make sure to have the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) installed and run:

```bash
expo init --template @husam287/expo-template
```

## âš¡ Stack and Dependencies

* [**React Navigation**](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/): For navigating through screens, we are using react navigation's tab and stack navigators. Additionally, react navigation has [custom theming support](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/themes) built in, which is defined in *src/constants/theme*. 
* [**Redux Toolkit**](): We use redux toolkit to manage universal state. An introduction into redux toolkit can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zySeP5vH9c).
* [**Axios hooks**](): To use axios as react hook with the aim of [axios hook package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-hooks)
* [**Icomoon**](): To use custom icons using icon component and files generated from [Icomoon website](https://icomoon.io/)
* **Absolute Imports:** To avoid annoying relative.importsmaking-life-easier-with-absolute-imports-react-in-javascript-and-typescript-bbdab8a8a3a1).
* **Form Validation:** We are using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) to validate our user inputs, checking them in our form-input component while passing the yup schema in the screens. [This tutorial](https://dev.to/franciscomendes10866/react-form-validation-with-react-hook-form-and-yup-4a98) is useful to reference. 

## ðŸ”§ Usage
> Be sure to have the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) installed.

```bash
expo init [name] --template @husam287/expo-template
```

### ðŸ’»  **Development Practices**
1. **Responsive:** Make sure to utilize responsive sizing for components and using responsive color values (defined in theme.ts) where necessary.
2. **Lightweight Files:** Keep files under ~500 lines of code. If you much longer than this you should probably be creating a different component to import in.
3. **Compilation and Formatting:** Strongly type when possible to cut down on runtime errors while also linting code often to maintain strong formatting.
4. **Naming Conventions:**   
    *Files/Directories:* all lower case with - for spaces (ex. form-input.tsx)   
    *Components/Interfaces:* Capital first letter and CamelCase (ex. \<FormInput />)  
    *Variables:* camelCase (ex. const isLoading)


## ðŸ“‚ Organization 
`src/components`: useful re-usable component library.  
`src/constants`: app constants, such as theme, that remain consistent throughout the app.   
`src/reducers`: redux features, organized using the slice pattern.   
`src/hooks`: useful hooks that can be re-used throughout the app.  
`src/routes`: react-navigation navigators, including stack and tab navigators.  
`src/screens`: the main screens of the app.  
`src/api`: apis using axios hooks; organized as endpoints, axios configuration 
`src/assets`: all assets
